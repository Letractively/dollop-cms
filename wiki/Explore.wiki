<h3>Basic of functionality</h3>
<p>The universal construction of files and folders in Dollop gives you opportunity to easy manage and develop different types of modules and add-ons. What we mean when we saying modules and add-ons, what's are differences and importance.&nbsp;<br>The modules in Dollop are folders that's contents basics functionality sectors like already knowable part of websites, users, news, blogs and etc.<br>The add-ons are the sub-functionality in the modules. I will give you one quick example to understand me correctly. Lets say we have module "news" in our website and we need to add a comment to already created module. The solution is very easily. We just need to add comment add-on in add-on folder build.prop int configuration will supply part of configuration that's needed by installation of "comment" add-on. I must note here if you are new to Dollop, that the all installations in platform Dollop are only executable inlet from users that's have access to Control Panel. The customisation of HTML design can be done by editing a default comment template file in module "news" or just copy template file in used theme and modified from there.<br>One of futures of Dollop is to show all available searched templates and themes sub files.</p>
<p>Note:<br>&nbsp;When installing the Dollop CMS kernel class is used like a real class<br>&nbsp;in other cases kernel class is &nbsp;used in static mode, working&nbsp;only with functions.&nbsp;<br>This does not mean, the function do not interact one with other function.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Boot file</h3>
<p>The format of this file is init.<br>This file contending all configuration of website. It's very imported to have backup of this file with your last changes. Other options available for this file are glue code and master initial configuration, allow you to manipulate whole website.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Glue code&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This option can attach PHP script with custom configuration and variables used by the external source to main source of Dollop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Master/Slave configuration</h3>
<p>Other good future you can examine is master/slave configuration. The idea of this is to load your desired configuration without unpleasant search in configuration fies.<br>To perform this operation, you must prepare "[BOOT].prop" and fill needed strings with data.<br>Now upload file in to root of website and erase "config.php" and reload your website. Click submit on showed form and "next" on second page of installation shield. This operation will re-build Dollop configuration.<br>In future I will show all default configuration strings used in Dollop.</p>

<h3>Classes from class library</h3>
<p>Now is time to mention how to load the PHP classes from class library.<br>Classes are grouped in folders like HTML, MySQL and etc. Like this way you can use many different class that have same use or functionality.<br>One good example, loading mysql_air class like $mysql=new mysql_ai;<br>This will load "ai.php" class feom mysql folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
