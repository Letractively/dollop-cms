KNOWN ISSUES
========================= 

        NOTE:
        This version of Dollop is unstable and not all of its problems have been identified.
        Feel free to help us establish all shortcomings of Dollop.
    
        - VERY IMPORTANT: the `.htaccess` file must be loaded by Apache.
        - The installation manager doesn't always show the main content of installation manager
 (refresh it in this case). 
        - The requirements checker is not tested thoroughly and may have some problems with establishing Dollop requirements.
 
 
 
REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES
=========================

        - LINUX web server.
        - Apache version 2.0 (or higher) is recommended.
        - *The `RewriteEngine` is required! Check the `.htaccess` file for more info.

        NOTE:
        At the moment Dollop can be run properly only on a Linux server with “Apache 2” and Mysql database.


    
INSTALLATION PREPARATIONS
=========================

        - Confirm that the user under which Apache runs has permission to write into the website directory.
        - Check can be done e.g. via `ls -la` command on the website root directory.
        - Confirm that the mcrypt extension is installed and running properly . 
        - For installation on Ubuntu server just use `sudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt` for installation.
        - Confirm that the GD Library is installed and running properly (bundle library). 
        - For installation on Ubuntu server just use `sudo apt-get install php5-gd` for installation.
        - Confirm that the Mysql process is running on the server.





INSTALLATION        
=========================
    
1. Download and extract Dollop

   You can obtain the latest Dollop release from http://fire1.eu. "dollop files"
   are available in   .zip formats and can be extracted using most
   compression tools.

   To download and extract the files, on a typical Unix/Linux command line, use
   the following commands:

   $  wget http://(for now is not available)
   $  tar -zxvf dollop-[code name].xx.tar.gz

   This will create a new `dollop-[code name].xx/` containing all Dollop files and directories. Next move the contents of that directory into a directory within your web server's document root or your public HTML directory, continue with this command:

   $  mv dollop-[code name].xx/* dollop-[code name].xx/.htaccess /path/to/your/installation

2. Optionally, download a translation

   By default, Dollop is installed in English, and other languages may be installed later. If you prefer to install Dollop in another language from the start do the following:


   - Download a translation file for the correct Dollop version and language
     from the translation server: http://(for now is not available)

   - Place the file into your language directory. 
       language/

   For detailed instructions, visit http://fire1.eu/


3. Run the install script

   You will be guided through several screens to set up the database, add the
   site maintenance account (the first user, also known as user/1 (superadmin) ), and provide all web site settings.
   
   During installation, several files and directories need to be created, which
   the install script will try to do automatically. However, on some hosting
   environments, manual steps are required, and the install script will tell
   you that it cannot proceed until you fix certain issues.
   
    This is normal and does not indicate a problem with your server.

4. Tips

a). If you get problems with connection to MySQL  just delete the 'db.php' file from server.
     The installation manager will ask again for MySQL information.
     This option is available to the moment  "[BOOT].dp" file exists on website root. 

b). Always make a backup for "[BOOT].dp"  in cases  your  upgrading to newer version.

c). The Boot file can replace  whole properties given by "*.prop" files.

d). Custom data for User's social networks are moved to Boot file in order   reduction, conflicts in case of updating newer version.

e). The Boot file have option to attach other major PHP scripts by using glue code function.
