==Creating a Theme for Dollop 4==

 

===Simple and Fast===

To create a theme in Dollop 4 you must browse the folder "themes"  from your website root, in this directory you must create your own folder for the new theme.
In order to work, your theme should have the following required files: "theme.prop","theme.html", "style.css" and the folder "templates" in which have "template.prop".

Next fill in your theme.html  file with the desired html data and Dollopâ€™s html sectors, then upload your css file to the theme directory and rename it to style.css.
Now you're ready! You can activate your theme from the Control Panel.





==Advanced HTML Design==

Do not think that all the html design ends here - the Dollop project has 3 types of design - system design from modules, custom design from themes and spare parts for emergency mode in case something is missing .
Before we continue you must review the [HTMLpaths], in case you've missed it. 

As you can see, Dollop has different types of files and structure. When you customise your prop. files with data desired to modify your design theme, design can end in seconds with maximum flexibility.

 

===Mobile Theme===

Your website mobile theme is contained in subfolder called by default "mobile". Also the mobile templates sets  for theme and modules are placed in the same sub-folder (mobile). 

You should know also, the changing name of mobile folder from  "boot file" will cause shift of overall website configuration.
